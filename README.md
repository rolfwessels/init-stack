![Init stack](./docs/logo.png)

# üåê Init stack

Streamline your project setup with Smart Templating. Init-Stack automates the initial setup of new software projects by cloning your chosen GitHub repository template, then intelligently renaming files and replacing identifiers within the source code to match your new project's name.

## üîç Using the cli

Just pick a project and then a new file name

```bash
.\init-stack new 
```

If you have a folder that you would like to use as template then call.
```cmd
.\init-stack new c:\project\Template\MyprojectName 
```

To set the output name and folder, run the following
```cmd
.\init-stack new c:\project\Template\MyprojectName MyNewName -o c:\Project\
```

If you know the project name then just use the name
```bash
.\init-stack new template-dotnet-core-console-app NewConsoleApp -o .
```
The new project will also be adding a git init with a commit message. If you would like to override the user and email run 
```bash
.\init-stack new template-dotnet-core-console-app NewConsoleApp -o . --git-name rolf --git-email rolf@home.com
```


## üöÄ Getting started as developer

This project comes with a development container will all the tooling required to build publish and deploy a project. Simply run the following commands to start development in the container.

```bash
# bring up dev environment
make build up
# test the project
make test
# run default package
make start
# build the project ready for publish
make publish
```

To deploy a docker image you can use the following commands

```bash
# Build docker images and push to repository
make docker-build docker-login docker-push 
# or just
make docker-publish
# to make an additional release of the docker image for this branch
make  docker-pull-short-tag docker-tag-env env=latest
# to update the deployment call
make deploy env=dev
```
## üõ† Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Docker installed on your machine. See [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Git, for version control. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Ability to run make file, eg. `wsl` 

## üìã Available make commands

### üíª Commands outside the container

- `make up` : brings up the container & attach to the default container
- `make down` : stops the container
- `make build` : builds the container

### üê≥ Commands to run inside the container

- `start` : Run the Init stack
- `test` : Test the Init stack
- `publish` : Publish the Init stack
- `docker-login` : Login to docker registry
- `docker-build` : Build the docker image
- `docker-push` : Push the docker image
- `docker-pull-short-tag` : Pull the docker image based in git short hash
- `docker-tag-env` : Tag the docker image based in the environment
- `docker-publish` : Publish the docker image
- `deploy` : Deploy the Init stack
- `update-packages` : Update the packages`

## üíª Development

### ‚ûï Add a project

```
dotnet new classlib -n InitStack.Core -o ./src/InitStack.Core
dotnet new nunit -n InitStack.Core.Tests -o ./tests/InitStack.Core.Tests
dotnet sln InitStack.sln add ./src/InitStack.Core/InitStack.Core.csproj
dotnet sln InitStack.sln add ./tests/InitStack.Core.Tests/InitStack.Core.Tests.csproj
dotnet sln InitStack.sln list
```

### üîÑ Versioning

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning scheme for software that conveys meaning about the underlying changes. It's composed of three segments:

1. **Major** version (`MAJOR`): Incremented for incompatible API changes.
2. **Minor** version (`MINOR`): Incremented for backward-compatible functionality additions.
3. **Patch** version (`PATCH`): Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

Updating version numbers:

- Manual updates to `MAJOR` and `MINOR` versions using a `versionPrefix` variable in the makefile.
- Automatic determination of `PATCH` levels based on commit messages in the `main` branch.
- Addition of pre-release identifiers for non-main branches, derived from the commit delta between feature branches and the main branch.

To test what the current version is just call

```bash
make version
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

Our project adheres to a modified version of the [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) workflow, tailored to streamline our release process.

### Feature/Bug Branches

- **Creation**: Developers create feature branches off the `main` branch for new features or bug fixes.
- **Naming Convention**: Feature branches are named with the prefix `feature/` followed by a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-login`).
- **Bug fixes**: Branches are named with the prefix `bug/` followed by a descriptive name (e.g., `bug/fix-login-button`).

### Main Branch

- The `main` branch holds the production-ready code.
- Changes from `feature` are merged into `main` when they are complete
- The build pipeline will deploy from `main` to development environments as required

### Releases

- **Tagging**: Instead of creating a release branch, we use tags to mark a new release.
- **Process**:
  1. When we're ready to release, we ensure that `main` is stable and all desired changes for the release have been merged.
  2. We then create a tag from the `main` branch with the version number, following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (e.g., `v1.2.0`).
  4. The tagged commit in the `main` branch is considered the official release of that version.

### Hotfixes

- Hotfixes are created off the `v1.xxx` tag if urgent fixes are needed in production.
- Once completed, hotfixes are merged back into both `main`, and a new tag is created to mark the hotfix release (e.g., `v1.2.1`).

## FAQ

**Question**: Can I use this application on Windows or Linux?

**Answer**: Yes, the application is cross-platform and can be run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

**Question**: How do I update to the latest version?

**Answer**: Pull the latest changes from the repository and rebuild your Docker container.
